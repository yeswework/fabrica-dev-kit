{"name":"php","version":"1.8.0","description":"Installs and maintains php and php modules","long_description":"# php Cookbook\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/php.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/php) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/php.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/php)\n\nIt installs and configures PHP and the PEAR package management system.  Also includes LWRPs for managing PEAR (and PECL) packages, PECL channels, and PHP-FPM pools.\n\n## Requirements\n### Platforms\n- Debian, Ubuntu\n- CentOS, Red Hat, Oracle, Scientific, Amazon Linux\n- Fedora\n- Microsoft Windows\n\n### Chef\n- Chef 11+\n\n### Cookbooks\n- build-essential\n- xml\n- mysql\n- iis\n- windows\n\n## Attributes\n- `node['php']['install_method']` = method to install php with, default `package`.\n- `node['php']['directives']` = Hash of directives and values to append to `php.ini`, default `{}`.\n\nThe file also contains the following attribute types:\n- platform specific locations and settings.\n- source installation settings\n\n## Resource/Provider\nThis cookbook includes LWRPs for managing:\n- PEAR channels\n- PEAR/PECL packages\n\n### `php_pear_channel`\n[PEAR Channels](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/guide.users.commandline.channels.php) are alternative sources for PEAR packages.  This LWRP provides and easy way to manage these channels.\n\n#### Actions\n- :discover: Initialize a channel from its server.\n- :add: Add a channel to the channel list, usually only used to add private channels.  Public channels are usually added using the `:discover` action\n- :update: Update an existing channel\n- :remove: Remove a channel from the List\n\n#### Attribute Parameters\n- channel_name: name attribute. The name of the channel to discover\n- channel_xml: the channel.xml file of the channel you are adding\n\n#### Examples\n\n```ruby\n# discover the horde channel\nphp_pear_channel \"pear.horde.org\" do\n  action :discover\nend\n\n# download xml then add the symfony channel\nremote_file \"#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/symfony-channel.xml\" do\n  source \"http://pear.symfony-project.com/channel.xml\"\n  mode 0644\nend\nphp_pear_channel \"symfony\" do\n  channel_xml \"#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/symfony-channel.xml\"\n  action :add\nend\n\n# update the main pear channel\nphp_pear_channel 'pear.php.net' do\n  action :update\nend\n\n# update the main pecl channel\nphp_pear_channel 'pecl.php.net' do\n  action :update\nend\n```\n\n### `php_pear`\n[PEAR](http://pear.php.net/) is a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components. [PECL](http://pecl.php.net/) is a repository for PHP Extensions. PECL contains C extensions for compiling into PHP. As C programs, PECL extensions run more efficiently than PEAR packages. PEARs and PECLs use the same packaging and distribution system.  As such this LWRP is clever enough to abstract away the small differences and can be used for managing either.  This LWRP also creates the proper module .ini file for each PECL extension at the correct location for each supported platform.\n\n#### Actions\n- `:install`: Install a pear package - if version is provided, install that specific version\n- `:upgrade`: Upgrade a pear package - if version is provided, upgrade to that specific version\n- `:remove`: Remove a pear package\n- `:purge`: Purge a pear package (this usually entails removing configuration files as well as the package itself).  With pear packages this behaves the same as `:remove`\n\n#### Attribute Parameters\n- `package_name`: name attribute. The name of the pear package to install\n- version: the version of the pear package to install/upgrade.  If no version is given latest is assumed.\n- `preferred_state`: PEAR by default installs stable packages only, this allows you to install pear packages in a devel, alpha or beta state\n- `directives`: extra extension directives (settings) for a pecl. on most platforms these usually get rendered into the extension's .ini file\n- `zend_extensions`: extension filenames which should be loaded with zend_extension.\n- o`ptions`: Add additional options to the underlying pear package command\n\n#### Examples\n\n```ruby\n# upgrade a pear\nphp_pear \"XML_RPC\" do\n  action :upgrade\nend\n\n\n# install a specific version\nphp_pear \"XML_RPC\" do\n  version \"1.5.4\"\n  action :install\nend\n\n\n# install the mongodb pecl\nphp_pear \"mongo\" do\n  action :install\nend\n\n# install the xdebug pecl\nphp_pear \"xdebug\" do\n  # Specify that xdebug.so must be loaded as a zend extension\n  zend_extensions ['xdebug.so']\n  action :install\nend\n\n\n# install apc pecl with directives\nphp_pear \"apc\" do\n  action :install\n  directives(:shm_size => 128, :enable_cli => 1)\nend\n\n\n# install the beta version of Horde_Url\n# from the horde channel\nhc = php_pear_channel \"pear.horde.org\" do\n  action :discover\nend\nphp_pear \"Horde_Url\" do\n  preferred_state \"beta\"\n  channel hc.channel_name\n  action :install\nend\n\n\n# install the YAML pear from the symfony project\nsc = php_pear_channel \"pear.symfony-project.com\" do\n  action :discover\nend\nphp_pear \"YAML\" do\n  channel sc.channel_name\n  action :install\nend\n```\n\n### `php_fpm_pool`\nInstalls the `php-fpm` package appropriate for your distro (if using packages) and configures a FPM pool for you. Currently only supported in Debian-family operating systems and CentOS 7 (or at least tested with such, YMMV if you are using source).\n\nPlease consider FPM functionally pre-release, and test it thoroughly in your environment before using it in production\n\nMore info: [http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php](http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php)\n\n#### Actions\n- `:install`: Installs the FPM pool (default).\n- `:uninstall`: Removes the FPM pool.\n\n#### Attribute Parameters\n- `pool_name`: name attribute. The name of the FPM pool.\n- `listen`: The listen address. Default: `/var/run/php5-fpm.sock`\n- `user`: The user to run the FPM under. Default should be the webserver user for your distro.\n- `group`: The group to run the FPM under. Default should be the webserver group for your distro.\n- `process_manager`: Process manager to use - see [http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.configuration.php](http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.configuration.php). Default: `dynamic`\n- `max_children`: Max children to scale to. Default: 5\n- `start_servers`: Number of servers to start the pool with. Default: 2\n- `min_spare_servers`: Minimum number of servers to have as spares. Default: 1\n- `max_spare_servers`: Maximum number of servers to have as spares. Default: 3\n- `chdir`: The startup working directory of the pool. Default: `/`\n- `additional_config`: Additional parameters in JSON. Default: {}\n\n#### Examples\n\n```ruby\n# Install a FPM pool named \"default\"\nphp_fpm_pool \"default\" do\n  action :install\nend\n```\n\n## Recipes\n### default\nInclude the default recipe in a run list, to get `php`.  By default `php` is installed from packages but this can be changed by using the `install_method` attribute.\n\n### package\nThis recipe installs PHP from packages.\n\n### source\nThis recipe installs PHP from source.\n\n## Deprecated Recipes\nThe following recipes are deprecated and will be removed from a future version of this cookbook.\n- `module_apc`\n- `module_curl`\n- `module_fileinfo`\n- `module_fpdf`\n- `module_gd`\n- `module_ldap`\n- `module_memcache`\n- `module_mysql`\n- `module_pgsql`\n- `module_sqlite3`\n\nThe installation of the php modules in these recipes can now be accomplished by installing from a native package or via the new php_pear LWRP.  For example, the functionality of the `module_memcache` recipe can be enabled in the following ways:\n\n```ruby\n# using apt\npackage \"php5-memcache\" do\n  action :install\nend\n\n# using pear LWRP\nphp_pear \"memcache\" do\n  action :install\nend\n```\n\n## Usage\nSimply include the `php` recipe where ever you would like php installed.  To install from source override the `node['php']['install_method']` attribute with in a role or wrapper cookbook:\n\n####Role example:\n\n```ruby\nname \"php\"\ndescription \"Install php from source\"\noverride_attributes(\n  \"php\" => {\n    \"install_method\" => \"source\"\n  }\n)\nrun_list(\n  \"recipe[php]\"\n)\n```\n\n## Development\nThis section details \"quick development\" steps.
